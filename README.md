This machine learning project develops a K-means clustering algorithm to categorize food ingredients based on their nutritional content, focusing on macro-nutrients. The algorithm labels clusters using standard nutritional thresholds (e.g., high protein, low fat), providing consumers with a clearer understanding of their food choices and enables them to verify marketing claims. By applying this model to daily-consumed foods, our aim is to provide insights into the nutritional composition of different meal options. We intend to enhance dietary flexibility by allowing consumers to discover alternative food options while maintaining their nutritional goal. This approach combines machine learning with nutritional science to empower consumers to make informed dietary decisions, potentially improving health choices. The key innovation of this project lies in offering a nuanced understanding of food items beyond misleading marketing labels, creating a more accurate nutritional assessment, and supporting public health initiatives.
